# Nim for UE documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

These docs are work in progress. If you have experience with [NimForUE](https://github.com/jmgomez/NimForUE) please feel free to contribute.

# Developing the docs with Starlight

This project has [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) already setup, providing a development environment for the docs. This way you can use the same environment as the docs are built in - directly from the browser or VSCode. 

## Manual project setup

1. Have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
